# Pyunto Intelligence System Monitoring

This directory contains tools and utilities for monitoring your Pyunto Intelligence integration, detecting errors, and ensuring the reliability of your system.

## Overview

Effective monitoring is crucial for maintaining a reliable Pyunto Intelligence integration. The tools provided here help you:

1. Monitor API performance and usage
2. Detect and respond to errors
3. Set up alerts for critical issues
4. Implement backup strategies for your data
5. Maintain system health

## Components

### Performance Monitoring

The performance monitoring tools help you track API performance metrics such as:

- Response times
- Success rates
- Usage patterns
- Rate limiting status
- Quota consumption

### Error Detection

The error detection utilities help you identify, track, and respond to errors in your Pyunto Intelligence integration:

- Error pattern detection
- Automated recovery strategies
- Error logging and analysis
- Custom alerting

### Backup System

The backup utilities help you implement reliable backup strategies for your Pyunto Intelligence data:

- Configuration backups
- Results archiving
- Scheduled backup automation
- Database backup integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (for Python-based monitoring tools)
- Node.js 14+ (for JavaScript-based monitoring tools)
- Pyunto Intelligence API key with appropriate permissions
- Basic understanding of monitoring concepts

### Installation

Each monitoring component has its own installation instructions in its respective directory. Generally, you can install the Python components with:

```bash
cd [component-directory]
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And the Node.js components with:

```bash
cd [component-directory]
npm install
```

## Usage Examples

### Setting Up Basic API Monitoring

```python
from pyunto_monitor import PyuntoMonitor

# Initialize the monitor
monitor = PyuntoMonitor(
    api_key="your_api_key",
    alert_email="alerts@yourcompany.com"
)

# Set up basic monitoring
monitor.setup_basic_monitoring(
    check_interval_seconds=300,  # Check every 5 minutes
    response_time_threshold_ms=1000,  # Alert if response time exceeds 1 second
    error_rate_threshold=0.05,  # Alert if error rate exceeds 5%
    quota_warning_threshold=0.8  # Alert when 80% of quota is consumed
)

# Start monitoring
monitor.start()
```

### Implementing Error Detection and Recovery

```python
from pyunto_monitor import ErrorDetector, RecoveryStrategies

# Initialize the error detector
detector = ErrorDetector(
    api_key="your_api_key",
    log_file="error_log.jsonl"
)

# Configure recovery strategies
detector.add_recovery_strategy(
    error_code=429,  # Rate limiting
    strategy=RecoveryStrategies.EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF,
    max_retries=5
)

detector.add_recovery_strategy(
    error_code=500,  # Server error
    strategy=RecoveryStrategies.RETRY_WITH_FALLBACK,
    fallback_endpoint="backup_api_endpoint",
    max_retries=3
)

# Start error detection
detector.start()
```

### Setting Up Automated Backups

```python
from pyunto_backup import BackupManager

# Initialize the backup manager
backup = BackupManager(
    api_key="your_api_key",
    storage_path="/path/to/backups"
)

# Schedule configuration backup
backup.schedule_config_backup(
    frequency="daily",
    time="02:00",  # 2 AM
    retention_days=30  # Keep backups for 30 days
)

# Schedule results backup
backup.schedule_results_backup(
    frequency="hourly",
    retention_days=7  # Keep hourly backups for 7 days
)

# Start backup manager
backup.start()
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Set up continuous monitoring to catch issues early
2. **Alert Thresholds**: Configure appropriate alert thresholds to avoid alert fatigue
3. **Backup Strategy**: Implement a comprehensive backup strategy with regular testing
4. **Error Analysis**: Regularly review error logs to identify patterns and improvement opportunities
5. **Documentation**: Keep documentation of your monitoring setup for operational continuity

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **High Response Times**
   - Check your network connection
   - Verify if you're exceeding rate limits
   - Consider implementing request batching

2. **Frequent 429 Errors**
   - Implement rate limiting on your side
   - Distribute requests more evenly
   - Consider upgrading your plan for higher limits

3. **Backup Failures**
   - Check storage permissions
   - Verify sufficient disk space
   - Ensure your API key has necessary permissions
